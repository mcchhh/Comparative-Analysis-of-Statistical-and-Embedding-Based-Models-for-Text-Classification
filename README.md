# Statistical vs. Embedding-Based Models: A Comparative Study in Text Classification. 

This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. 

## Aims and Objectives 
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of statistical models (such as Naive Bayes and SVMs) versus embedding-based models (such as Word2Vec and BERT) in text classification, specifically using the AG News datase. Statistical odels focus on probability and word frequencies, while embedding-based models use deep learning to capture semantic relationships and context. The study seeks to compare the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in a multi-class news categorisation task, offering insights into the best model choices based on specific classification needs. 

## Data Description 
The dataset selected for this project is the AG News Classification data, which is accessible via Kaggle. This dataset comprises 127,600 news articles, organised into four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science?Technology. 

## Evaluation Metrics 
This project will evaluate text classification models using two key metrics: Accuracy and F1-Score. Accuracy measure the proportion of correct predictions overall, providing insight into the model's general effectiveness. The F1-Score, which balances Precision (correct positive predictions) and Recall (identifying actual positives), is valuable in multi-class classification tasks, ensuring fair treatment of all categories. By using both metrics, the evaluation will capture both overall correctness and the model's ability to handle minority classes, offering a comprehensive assessment of its performance. 

## Implementation 
Developed using Python language and Jupyter Noteboook. Provide well-commented Python code. Starting off with a baseline perfromance, then a comparative classification appraoch with BiLSTM and Gaussian Naive Bayes on both statistical and embedding using TF-IDF and Word2Vec, and lastly a comparative analysis between them.
